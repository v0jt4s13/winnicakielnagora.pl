## Absolute prohibitions

### STOP — immediate revert

Violation = revert NOW, no discussion.

1. **NEVER** store PII (email, IP, phone, full name, payment data) as plaintext in the database — use a hash (for lookup) + encrypted ciphertext (for retrieval), or column-level encryption provided by your DB/ORM.
2. **NEVER** build SQL queries via string concatenation or template literal interpolation of user input — always use parameterized queries (`$1`, `?`, `:name`, etc.) of your DB driver / ORM.
3. **NEVER** commit secrets (JWT signing keys, encryption keys, API keys, DB passwords, OAuth client secrets) to the repository — environment variables only, via `.env` / your secrets manager.
4. **NEVER** log PII in plaintext — strip query strings from logged URLs; hash or mask emails, IPs, tokens before they hit any log sink.

<!--
Add your own STOP-level rules below. Guidance: only add a rule here if
violating it causes a security, legal, or data-integrity incident —
everything softer belongs in BLOCK.
Examples:
5. NEVER bypass row-level security policies in admin tooling
6. NEVER write across tenant boundaries in a multi-tenant query
-->

### BLOCK — do not merge without fix

Violation = fix before merge, PR blocked.

<!--
Fill in after /discover-standards. These are the "always/never" rules specific
to your architecture. They catch the mistakes reviewers point out every week.
Examples:
1. NEVER add an endpoint under /api/private/ without the auth middleware
2. NEVER access the database from route handlers directly — always go through
   the Repository / data-access layer
3. NEVER use console.log — always use the project logger
4. NEVER import from the legacy / deprecated package
5. NEVER edit generated files (e.g. Prisma client, OpenAPI output)
-->

## Decision priorities

When values conflict, this hierarchy resolves:

1. **PII and user-data security** — breaches have legal, reputational, and often existential consequences.
2. **Data integrity** — corrupted data with no rollback is worse than downtime.
3. **Public / customer-facing surface stability** — public endpoints, embedded widgets, and integrations that third parties depend on.
4. **API contract compatibility** — breaking changes cascade to every client.
5. **Code readability and consistency** — predictable patterns make multi-developer + AI development sustainable.

<!--
Adjust this ordering if your project has a different top priority (e.g. a
realtime system might place availability above data integrity). Keep it to
5 items max — a priority list that long stops being a priority list.
-->

## Architectural boundaries

<!--
Fill in the layer boundaries that must not be crossed in your codebase.
Format: {Layer A} -> NEVER {action that violates layering} ({why})
Examples:
1. Route handler -> NEVER writes raw SQL — always through the Repository layer
2. Repository -> NEVER imports from routes/ or middlewares/ — data layer doesn't know about transport
3. UI components -> NEVER call the database directly — always via the API client
4. Background worker -> NEVER imports HTTP framework code
-->

_(add project-specific boundaries here)_

## Consistency rules

<!--
"When you add X, you must also add Y." These keep the codebase symmetric.
Examples:
1. When adding a new PII field -> ALWAYS add the _hash + _encoded pair
2. When adding a new endpoint under /api/private/ -> ALWAYS add the auth middleware
3. When adding a user-facing string -> ALWAYS add a translation key (no hardcoded text)
4. When adding a new DB model -> ALWAYS create an interface, a Repository, and an export
-->

_(add project-specific consistency rules here)_

## Allowed exceptions

<!--
Document the edge cases where the rules above can be intentionally broken,
and WHY. Without this section, juniors and AI agents will either bend rules
silently or refuse to ship valid changes.
Examples:
1. console.* in browser-only widget code — the server logger isn't available there
2. Raw interpolation of a hardcoded constant column name — parameterization
   can't cover identifiers in all drivers
-->

_(add project-specific allowed exceptions here)_

## Definition of "done"

A change is complete ONLY when:

- [ ] The project's linter / formatter passes with no errors (see `Commands` in AGENTS.md)
- [ ] The type-checker / compiler passes with no errors
- [ ] Tests relevant to the change pass locally
- [ ] No secrets or plaintext PII in staged files (see Prohibitions #3, #4)
- [ ] Every new rule that was introduced during implementation has been captured via `/sync-standards` or an entry in this file
- [ ] The spec file (if any) has its `## Implementation Checklist` updated

<!--
Add project-specific "done" criteria here — e.g. "widget rebuild has run",
"migration has been tested against a prod-sized snapshot", "translations
have been exported".
-->

## Architectural decisions

<!--
Document non-obvious architectural choices that AI agents should respect
rather than "improve". For each decision, write:

### {Decision name}
- **Choice**: {what we picked}
- **Why**: {the constraint or tradeoff that made this the right choice}
- **Consequence**: {what agents must do / must not do because of it}

Examples: "Raw SQL instead of ORM", "Event sourcing for audit trail",
"Single monolith instead of microservices", "Feature flags via {provider}".

Without this section, agents will default to best-practices-in-general
instead of best-practices-for-this-project.
